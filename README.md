# DNA-Analysis
C++ program that examines both hemoglobin genes for each of four people, with each gene consisting of 444 DNA bases (A,C,G,T).

 - Problem:
    DNA analysis is an important part of medical exploration and
    discovery. Sickle-cell anemia is a disorder that is caused by a single mutation
    in the hemoglobin gene. A sickle hemoglobin gene has a T in the 20th position.
    A person is anemic if he/she has two sickle hemoglobin genes.
    A person is a carrier if he/she has one sickle hemoglobin gene.
    Otherwise, the person is normal.
  
    This program examines both hemoglobin genes for
    each of four people, with each gene consisting of 444 DNA bases
    (A,C,T,G). These are the four bases (letters) that make up DNA.

 - Input: DNA of the two hemoglobin genes of four people. The input file (dna.txt) contains the gene DNA information in this order:
    geneA1
    geneA2
    geneB1
    geneB2
    geneC1
    geneC2
    geneD1
    geneD2
    ** Note: 1 and 2 denote the first and second gene, and A,B,C,D denote people.

 - Output: In the output file, (DNAanalysis.txt), it is indicated whether each person is anemic, a carrier, or normal and whether any of the four individuals are related.
